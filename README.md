# Anchor Dice Game

## Overview

This Solana-based decentralized application (dApp) allows players to place and resolve bets in a secure, transparent, and decentralized manner. The program is built using the Anchor framework, which simplifies the development of Solana programs by providing a structured and easy-to-use environment.
Key Features

* Bet Placement: Players can place bets with a specified amount of SOL, which is securely stored in a house-controlled vault.
* Signature Verification: The program utilizes Ed25519 signatures to ensure the integrity and authenticity of bet placements and resolutions, preventing tampering or fraudulent activities.
* Bet Resolution: The outcome of each bet is determined by a cryptographic hash, ensuring fairness and randomness. The program also applies a configurable house edge to determine the final payout.
* Event Emission: Upon resolving a bet, the program emits events that log the outcome, providing transparency and an auditable record of all bet results.

## Architecture

The program revolves around several key instructions and account structures:

* PlaceBet: Facilitates the placement of a bet by a player. It involves transferring SOL to a vault and initializing a Bet account to store the details of the wager.
* ResolveBet: Handles the resolution of a placed bet. It verifies the bet's signature, calculates the outcome using a cryptographic hash, and transfers the payout to the player if they win.
* House Vault Management: The program uses program-derived accounts (PDAs) to manage vaults where SOL is stored securely until the bet is resolved.

## Security Considerations

* Signature Verification: To ensure that bets are legitimate and have not been tampered with, the program verifies Ed25519 signatures against the expected public key of the house.
* House Edge: A house edge is applied to all bets, ensuring that the house retains a small percentage of all payouts, thus sustaining the operation of the dApp.
* Fairness and Transparency: By using cryptographic hashing and event emission, the program ensures that all bet outcomes are both fair and publicly verifiable.

This program provides a robust foundation for decentralized betting on the Solana blockchain, leveraging the speed, security, and scalability of Solana, combined with the ease of use provided by the Anchor framework.

## Initialize Instruction
### Overview

The Initialize instruction is used to transfer a specified amount of SOL from the house account to a derived vault account. This setup can be used in decentralized applications (dApps) where an initial deposit is required into a vault account for further operations.
Accounts

The following accounts are required by the Initialize instruction:

*    house (Signer):
        Type: Signer<'info>
        Mutability: Mutable (mut)
        Description: This is the account that authorizes and initiates the transfer of SOL. The account must sign the transaction.

*    vault (SystemAccount):
        Type: SystemAccount<'info>
        Mutability: Mutable (mut)
        Description: The target account where the SOL will be transferred to. This account is derived using a seed that includes the house account's public key, ensuring a unique vault for each house. The account is expected to be initialized with sufficient lamports.

*    system_program (Program):
        Type: Program<'info, System>
        Description: A reference to the Solana System Program, which is responsible for managing SOL transfers and account creations.

### Seed Derivation

The vault account is derived using the following seeds:

*    A static string: "vault"
    The public key of the house account: house.key().as_ref()

The combination of these seeds guarantees that each house account has a unique vault account associated with it.
Instruction: initialize
Parameters

*    amount:
        Type: u64
        Description: The amount of SOL (in lamports) to be transferred from the house account to the vault account.

### Execution Flow

* CPI Context Setup:
    A Cross-Program Invocation (CPI) context is created for the Solana System Program's transfer function. This context includes:
        The from account as house.
        The to account as vault.
        The System Program as the program to execute the transfer.

*    SOL Transfer:
    The transfer function from the System Program is called with the constructed CPI context, and the specified amount is transferred from house to vault.

Example Usage

Here is a brief example of how you might call this instruction in your dApp:

```rust
// Initialize accounts
let initialize_accounts = Initialize {
    house: house_account,
    vault: vault_account,
    system_program: system_program_account,
};

// Specify the amount to transfer
let amount_to_transfer: u64 = 1_000_000; // 1 SOL (in lamports)

// Call the initialize function
initialize_accounts.initialize(amount_to_transfer)?;
```

### Error Handling

If the transfer fails, the instruction will return a Result::Err, and no SOL will be moved. Ensure the house account has sufficient balance before calling this instruction to avoid runtime errors.


## PlaceBet Instruction

### Overview

The PlaceBet instruction facilitates the creation of a bet by a player. It involves transferring a specified amount of SOL from the player's account to a house-controlled vault, and it initializes a new Bet account to store the details of the bet.

### Accounts

The following accounts are required by the PlaceBet instruction:

*    player (Signer):
        Type: Signer<'info>
        Mutability: Mutable (mut)
        Description: The player placing the bet. This account will authorize and pay for the transaction and will also fund the bet by transferring SOL to the vault.

*    house (UncheckedAccount):
        Type: UncheckedAccount<'info>
        Description: The account representing the house, which typically owns the vault. This account is unchecked, meaning it is not validated by the Solana runtime for safety, hence the CHECK comment in the code.

*    vault (SystemAccount):
        Type: SystemAccount<'info>
        Mutability: Mutable (mut)
        Description: The vault account associated with the house where the SOL from the player's bet is deposited. This account is derived using a seed that includes the house's public key, ensuring that each house has a unique vault.

*    bet (Account, Bet):
        Type: Account<'info, Bet>
        Mutability: New (init)
        Description: The new Bet account that is initialized to store the details of the player's bet. This account is created and paid for by the player. It is also derived using seeds that include the vault's public key and a unique seed provided by the player.

*    system_program (Program):
        Type: Program<'info, System>
        Description: A reference to the Solana System Program, which is responsible for managing SOL transfers and account creations.

### Seed Derivation

*    vault Account: Derived using the following seeds:
        A static string: "vault"
        The public key of the house account: house.key().as_ref()

*    bet Account: Derived using the following seeds:
        A static string: "bet"
        The public key of the vault account: vault.key().as_ref()
        The seed parameter, which is a unique u128 value provided by the player and converted to a byte array.

2. Constructs a CPI context with the system_program.
3. Calls the transfer function to move the specified amount of SOL.

Returns: 
* Result<()> - Indicates successful execution or error.

Example Usage

Here's an example of how to use the PlaceBet instruction in a dApp:

```rust
// Initialize the PlaceBet accounts
let place_bet_accounts = PlaceBet {
    player: player_account,
    house: house_account,
    vault: vault_account,
    bet: bet_account,
    system_program: system_program_account,
};

// Call the create_bet function
place_bet_accounts.create_bet(seed, roll, bet_amount, &bumps)?;

// Deposit the bet amount into the vault
place_bet_accounts.deposit(bet_amount)?;
```

Error Handling

* Insufficient Funds: If the playerâ€™s account does not have enough SOL to cover the amount, the deposit function will return an error.
* Account Initialization Failure: If the Bet account cannot be initialized (e.g., due to insufficient lamports for rent-exemption), an error will be returned.


## ResolveBet Instruction

### Overview

The ResolveBet instruction is responsible for resolving a bet that has been placed by a player. 

This includes verifying the bet's validity through an Ed25519 signature, determining the outcome of the bet based on a cryptographic hash, and transferring the appropriate payout to the player if they win. 

The house edge is taken into account during the payout calculation.
